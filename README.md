# When and Why Your Code Starts to Smell Bad.

Technical Debt: "not quite right code which we postpone making it right." [Cunningham]

Bad code smells are surface-level signs, that suggest a deeper problem within code. Such symptoms in code are often attributed to the pressure on professional programmers to develop features in tight time frames, with release dates prioritised over code quality. 

Bad code smells increase the size of technical debt in a project, tending to result from poor design and implementation planning. Tight deadlines for programmers may encourage professionals to devout less time to planning the design, instead diving into creating tangible results.

The evolution of software is often blamed for the existence of bad code smells, however, the study found such problems within code tended to be present from creation. As such, it should be possible to prevent bad code smells with effective quality checks when committing code to a project. Another common believe held, is that newcomers are chiefly responsible for bad code smells, yet, this papers argues developers with high workloads and release pressure proved to be a higher contributor. It is argued that current tools used to manage bad code smells, such as static-code analysis and constraint-based reasoning over metric values, do not target the reason such symptoms originate.

## What Should We Teach New Software Developers? Why?

This paper argues that there is a 'disconnect between computer science education and what industry needs', with industry often complaining graduates lack programming proficiency. 

Stroustrup suggests students tend to struggle with connecting topics covered in different classes, leading to graduates with good grades, yet lacking the ability to produce functioning and maintainable code. 

Computer science education, Stroustrup argues, needs a standardised structure with a clearer definition of what an individual needs in order to earn the title of Computer Scientists. Perhaps one day leading to licensing of Computer Science professionals. In order to do so, professionals should not purely posses a generalised understanding of computer science, but have obtained a specialism within the field.
